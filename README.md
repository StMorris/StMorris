#### Hi there,

I am Tomisin Titiloye, i have an interesting relationship with data, i like to crawl around environments where they are stored, its even more fun when i get the chance to move them across different environments üôÉ. Our conversations are the best, sometimes im getting feedbacks on how the day went?, what made the most sense?, othertimes, we try to see into the future üòÅ.

I joined Github to publish my curiousity, explore various tools and techniques, and identify best practices in the process. 



instruction to me: update the contents boy!!!!
